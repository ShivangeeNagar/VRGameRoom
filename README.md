Welcome to the README for the VR Haptics Perception Project developed during my tenure as a Research Assistant at Northeastern University. This project explores the realm of haptics perception within everyday virtual reality experiences, focusing on its implementation and evaluation on the Meta Quest 2 platform.

Project Overview

Virtual Reality (VR) has opened up new possibilities for immersive experiences, and understanding how haptics affect human perception is crucial for creating truly captivating virtual environments. The main objectives of this project were to investigate the levels and nuances of haptic feedback that are well-perceived by users during their interaction with VR content.
Features

The VR Haptics Perception Project comprises several key areas of focus:

    1. VR Locomotion: Exploring various methods of locomotion within the VR environment to provide users with comfortable and engaging movement options.

    2. Teleportation using Rugs: Implementing a teleportation mechanism that utilizes virtual rugs to enhance the realism of movement, ensuring an intuitive and enjoyable experience.

    3. Hand Models: Creating realistic hand models that accurately replicate users' hand movements and interactions within the VR world.

    4. bject Interaction: Enabling the interaction with virtual objects through realistic grabbing and manipulation mechanics, enhancing the sense of presence and agency.

    5. Object Motion Smoothing: Implementing techniques to ensure the natural and smooth movement of virtual objects, reducing any jarring or unrealistic motion.

    6. Sockets: Developing socket-based mechanics that allow users to interact with objects in a way that simulates real-world physics and mechanics.

    7. Haptics and Sounds: Integrating haptic feedback and spatial audio to enhance immersion, making interactions more engaging and responsive.

Deployment and Testing

The VR Haptics Perception Project has been successfully deployed on the Meta Quest 2 platform. Rigorous testing and user evaluations have been conducted to gauge the effectiveness of the haptic feedback and interaction mechanics across the various features mentioned above.
